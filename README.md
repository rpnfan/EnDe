# EnDe
A highly ergonomic English/ German keyboard layout for standard ISO keyboards or 3x6 columnar staggered keyboards. It has really good analyzer stats, but gives an even better typing feel :-) Can also be used for other European languages, such as Spanish, French or Dutch.

This layout is an alternative to anymak:END. It is based on the same proven principles. The difference to anymak:END are as follows:

* The default shift key position from a standard keyboard is used and not changed.This allows to use more keys and has two benefits and two disadvantages
* Due that change some analyzer statistics numbers, such as same-finger-bigrams have been improved.
* The layout includes all German diacritics on the base layer, instead of requiring to access them on a separate layer.
* The shift key is still in the not optimal to reach position. anymak:END in contrast does not use the ISO-shift key position at all and avoids this uncomfortable position.
* anymak:END has a one-shot layer key available on the right hand. That position is taken here for a character (ß), so does not allow to place the one-shot layer key there any longer.

If you prefer anymak:END or EnDe is a matter of preference. Both layouts will feel great, with somewhat different strong sides and weaker sides. But mostly the layouts are very similar (see details below).

The layout can be used directly on an ISO-keyboard.

And as well on a columnar staggered split keyboard.

For both keyboard types the handpositions stay exactly the same and are symmetrical for the left and right hand.

## Statistics

The screenshots are taken from the analyzer from Cyanophage and give a first impression how the layout fares. I compare the layouts to Graphite, which is at the moment a layout often suggested. That works good in English and also reasonably well for German. Try out both on some common English and German words and see which you like better. The statistics are helpful to rule out bad layouts, but will not help you to decide for your personal favorite one!

The EnDe layout scores very well in regards to statistics. But note that the analyzers do not fully describe the typing experience. The suggested layout could slightly be tweaked to get a tiny bet better SFBs (same-finger-bigrams) by swapping m-w, but I deliberately have chosen the current position, because I find it slightly easier to type that way. You can swap those two characters if you prefer.

In comparison to Graphite I think one of the biggest advantages is the higher amount of inward rolls, while awkward finger motions you want to avoid (sciccors, directs and SFBs) are roughly in the same range for both layouts.

As a bonus here the stats for some other languages, where you can see that EnDe works also great for Dutch or Spanish for example.
